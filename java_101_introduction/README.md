# COMP 2230-02: Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, and Program Design

# Java 101 Introduction

This folder provides a gentle introduction to Java programming concepts essential for COMP 2230-02: Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, and Program Design.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (from COMP 1230/1231)
- Familiarity with using a code editor and terminal

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this introduction, you should be comfortable with:
- Writing basic Java programs
- Using variables, data types, and operators
- Implementing control flow (if-else, loops)
- Creating and calling methods
- Working with classes and objects
- Using arrays for data storage
- Basic input/output operations

## Coding Level
The examples here use **beginner to intermediate Java syntax**. We focus on:
- Procedural programming with some OOP concepts
- Simple algorithms and data manipulation
- Clean, readable code with comments
- No advanced features (generics, exceptions handling, etc.) yet

## Topics Covered
1. [Basic Syntax](basic_syntax/) - Variables, data types, operators
2. [Control Flow](control_flow/) - If-else statements, loops
3. [Methods](methods/) - Function definition and calling
4. [Classes and Objects](classes_objects/) - OOP basics
5. [Arrays](arrays/) - Fixed-size data structures
6. [Input/Output](input_output/) - Console I/O

## How to Use
1. Read the README in each topic folder
2. Compile and run the Java files: `javac FileName.java` then `java FileName`
3. Modify the code to experiment
4. Use these concepts when implementing data structures in later labs

## Next Steps
After completing this introduction, you'll be ready for Lab 01's Big O analysis and subsequent data structure implementations.
